_This is a story from several months ago. I've been trying to find the right words, unsuccessfully, for a while now. Finally I decided to just write. So here goes._

It was a Saturday, a hot July afternoon. The streets were quiet, as usual. Walking down a Menlo Park street can be a lonely experience: to call the place a _neighborhood_ is to stretch the word to its limits. Multi-million-dollar houses appear utterly un-lived-in.

But Christy and I were together, carrying home the spoils of a successful on-foot expedition to the produce market a few blocks away. High on each other's good mood, arms overspilling with delicious goodies. Sharing an italian soda, we joked and canoodled our way down the empty street.

Suddenly an old woman was walking towards us from one of the houses. She didn't speak a word of English, and we don't speak a word of Japanese, but her frantic gentures got the message across that she needed help, so we went with her inside.

I took off my shoes at the door and looked around at the room. It was modestly decorated and quiet. Nothing seemed obviously amiss. Christy and I exchanged a glance wondering wordlessly what this was about. The woman &ndash; I never learned her name &ndash; motioned to us to follow farther inside the house.
