After a vigorous three months of job searching I recently became Emplyee #6 at [Preset](https://preset.io/)! We're a friendly bunch of nerds building sweet data visualization tools (and of course we're [hiring](https://preset.io/careers/) `/plug`).

In the end my job search landed me in the very lucky position of having several exciting companies interested in hiring me. Being me, I ended up agonizing over making the best possible decision. I spent a lot of time soul-searching -- though really, I can't help doing that anyway.

I began thinking a lot about what I really want work to be in my life. I've often seen my work as something that I should be deeply passionate about. As an art I must dutifully practice. With literature about things like "craftsmanship", the abundance of ever-fancier job titles, and a religious hyper-focus on code quality, we software developers often put our identity on the line for our work.

I've thought about myself this way for a long time, but now I think I will get much better results if I treat software development as something that I simply enjoy doing. The stakes don't have to be so high. Just get the job done.
