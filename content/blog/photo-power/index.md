A photo carries an incredible amount of power.

I came across a years-old photo the other day. Just one photo that I took, of some of my friends being goofs.
I was instantly transported to the moment of its taking, and all my memories of the months surrounding it.
Feelings, voices, laughs, images, all came rushing to me at once. This is time travel.

I am so grateful to live in an era where I can have such a relationship with my past and future selves.
