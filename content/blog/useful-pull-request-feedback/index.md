I was reminded recently how much of an impact good pull request feedback can have on a project. The right feedback should be enjoyable, improving the codebase while providing learning opportunities and strengthening team dynamics. It's important to communicate effectively, for all the same reasons it's important to structure our code effectively. That in mind, I thought I'd share some strategies you can employ to give good feedback.
