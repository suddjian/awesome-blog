Good pull request feedback can have a big impact on a software project. The right feedback should be enjoyable, improving the codebase while providing learning opportunities and strengthening team dynamics. It's important to communicate effectively, for all the same reasons it's important to structure our code effectively. That in mind, I thought I'd share some strategies you can employ to give good feedback.

This sounds obvious, like something that you should be learning in preschool, but sadly it can be quite common to see people ignoring basic courtesy when they're reviewing others' code. Maybe they are channeling Torvalds, maybe they just haven't thought about it much, but it's important to show respect for other people and their work, even when you think it should be better.
