I often have trouble getting it done.

It's usually when I'm attempting something new: it's just a little too daunting, and I'm paralyzed by lack of experience for a long time. Sometimes I'm so afraid of doing a bad job that I don't do it at all, and just keep kicking the can down the road until either someone else does it or it becomes irrelevant. I wish it wasn't scary to do something new -- my job would be a lot easier that way -- but it often is.

It would be nice to at least try and fail instead of just giving up. Actually failing is a way better feeling than being stuck thinking about how to avoid failure. At least that way you _tried_. Now you _know_ you can't do it, instead of just supposing.

I don't always end up paralyzed. Many times, I manage to push through that feeling and just do it anyway, and many times I don't get the paralysis feeling at all. Every single time that I manage to get it done, I think in retrospect that it was really such a small, easy task, and even in success, I feel bad about myself.

I suppose I'm mostly writing this to make myself think about it. Maybe if I'm more conscious of these feelings I can push through them to do better work.
