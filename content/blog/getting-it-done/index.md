I often have trouble getting it done.

It's usually when I attempt something new -- even if only part of it is new: I become paralyzed by fear of failure, or even just not doing it really well. Sometimes I'm so afraid of doing a bad job that I just kick the can down the road until either someone else does it or it becomes irrelevant. This is really embarrassing for me, because I love to learn and I love to do all kinds of things.

It would be a way better feeling to try and fail instead of just giving up. At least that way you _tried_. Now you _know_ you can't do it, instead of just supposing, and that has some value.

I don't always end up paralyzed. Many times, I manage to push through that feeling and just do it anyway, and many times I don't get the paralysis feeling at all. Every single time that I manage to get it done, I think in retrospect that it was really such a small, easy task, and even in success, I feel bad about myself.

I decided to write this to make myself think about it. Maybe if I'm more conscious of these self-destructive feelings I can push through them to do better.
