I often have trouble getting it done.

It's usually when I attempt something new. It doesn't have to be something amazing, just something a little different from what I've done before. Even if only part of it is new, I can become paralyzed by fear of failure, or just fear of not doing very well, or of not doing it _the right way_. Sometimes I'm so afraid of doing a bad job that I kick the can down the road until either someone else does it or it becomes irrelevant. This is really embarrassing for me, because I love to learn and do all kinds of creative things.

It would be a way better feeling to try and fail instead of just giving up. At least that way you _tried_, right? At least now you _know_ you can't do it, instead of just supposing, and that knowledge has some value. But logic doesn't count for much against a dumb emotional glitch embedded in your brain chemistry by millions of years of evolution.

Paralysis doesn't always get the best of me. Many times I don't get paralyzed at all. I breeze through the new experience like a normal person, and I feel great. And many times, through a great force of will, I eventually push through the paralysis and get it done anyway. But then I reprimand myself in retrospect that it was really such an easy task, and I should have never have had a problem with it in the first place, so that even in success, I find a way to feel bad about myself. That really needs to stop. I'm sick of that shit.

I decided to write this mostly to force myself to think about it. Maybe if I'm actively conscious of these self-destructive feelings it will be easier to push through them to do better. I want to have more proud moments and fewer regrets.
