When you settle into a routine, it's easy to forget that every moment of your life you have a choice. You could make any number of futures play out in front of you. Every time you take an action, you choose not to take a different action.

It's easy to stress out on the possible ways those choices could go wrong, and hide in the safety of the routine. But what if we instead took all that energy and put it into thinking about how we can make choices that go right?

How much more effective could we be? How much better might we feel about our decisions and ourselves? What might we accomplish together if we all try harder to seek opportunities instead of avoiding stumbling blocks?
