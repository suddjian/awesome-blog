I came across a years-old photo the other day.
A single photo that I took, of some then-new, now-old friends being goofs.
I was instantly transported to the moment of its taking, and my summed experience of the weeks surrounding it.
Feelings, voices, laughs, images, all came rushing to me at once.

In a way, a photo carries an incredible amount of power.
To me, it is time travel, in every sense that could be meaningful.
I am so grateful to live in an era where I can have such a relationship with my past and future selves.
