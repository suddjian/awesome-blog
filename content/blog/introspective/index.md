None of us truly knows the answer to any question

We all pass by one another every day

Pretending that we know what we are and where we're going

<br>

We should all go mad grasping at meaning

Instead we choose to live a great collective white lie

We walk oblivious, time's whisper at our backs

<br>

We pretend that we exist for reasons

We pretend that we exist for no reason

And we cope by saying *"someday maybe"*

<br>

Stop and be viscerally aware of your being and doing and thinking

The knife edge where your thoughts end and you begin

<br>

We naively hope to break the surface of this great cosmic sea of *yes*

To see beneath the roiling conscious foam

Our only tools, impossibly small poorly formed questions

And a strange fleshy *Id* that only knows how to yearn

<br>

Somehow I have gotten so far

Somehow I have gotten nowhere at all

*Someday, maybe*
