### DRAFT

Examples of platforms: Instagram, Slack, LinkedIn, GitHub
Examples of protocols: HTTP, Email, Bitcoin, Webmentions

If you want a platform to work for everyone, you need a massive amount of resources.
You need to spend piles of money on research.
A 1% drop in usability means a million people have problems.
A protocol will allow anyone to craft their own tools that _mostly_ work.
But it's much harder to make money off of a protocol. You can't advertise, people will just ignore the ads you send them.
You can't enforce any rules on your system that aren't for the common good because it's up to everyone to enforce the rules,
so you can't make people pay for features.
But you also don't need nearly as massive of a team or nearly as many resources spent,
so you don't need nearly as much monetization

If you build a protocol, you face a different set of challenges: adoption, monetization, and technicality.
Protocols are much harder to design than platforms.
Almost everyone in the engineering workforce is trained to build platforms. Google and Facebook are platforms.
Building protocols requires a different mindset. You can't just change everything, some things are off the table.
You have to choose what to control and what to release, but this is a healthier relationship with your creation.
A much smaller group of people can have a much vaster impact on the world.
