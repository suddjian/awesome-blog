Life isn't like a story in a book or a movie.

Stories have beginnings and endings. But beginnings and endings aren't real. They're just a convenience. You can't keep telling a story forever.

So many times, the most important things just sort of... hang there. Unresolved. With nothing you can do.

Sometimes you have to leave something behind. On the outside, walking away looks like an ending, but inside, to the person leaving, it never really ends.
There's a lingering, active experience of what you've walked away from. Feelings of grief, or relief, or both.

Perhaps death is like that too. On the outside, it looks like the end, but to the person dying, it just... lingers. Maybe.
