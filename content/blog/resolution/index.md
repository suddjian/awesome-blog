Been a while, thought I'd write some more.

Stories have beginnings and endings. But beginnings and endings aren't real. They're just a convenience. You probably don't want to keep telling a story forever.

Life is different. So many times, the most important story arcs just sort of... hang there. Unresolved.

Sometimes you have to leave something behind. A relationship, a career, a belief. It isn't really en ending. It doesn't get conveniently packaged and tied with a bow.

There's a lingering, present experience of what you've left. Feelings of grief, or relief, or both.

The soul can feel the future, and the past, at once. It lives outside of time.

Longing, dread, grief, hope, regret, love, are parts of the same experience.

The challenge of living in the present is that there is so much more past and future to feel.
