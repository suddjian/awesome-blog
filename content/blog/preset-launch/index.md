I finally get to join in announcing the official [launch of Preset](https://preset.io/blog/2019-10-09-series-a-announcement/, and our first round of funding! We had a great launch party last night with a big crowd of open source tech folks, founders, fancy VC folks, and friends and family. Our hope is to make powerful data analytics tools accessible to every person and organization. Data-driven development transforms organizations and the products they build, and we want to help teams unlock that power.

My efforts so far have mostly been focused on building our upcoming SaaS product. I can't reveal too much except that I've been building a lot of team-focused functionality. I've also gotten a chance to get my [toes wet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-superset/pull/8298) with my first couple of Superset changes. It's really cool to have an opportunity to work on such a popular open-source project, and I'm hoping to do more work on Superset soon.

I'm so excited to be a part of such an awesome, ambitious company. I've already grown a ton just in the past couple months working with some of the most skilled engineers I've ever met (successfully keeping imposter syndrome at bay, so far). Looking forward to great things ahead.

Oh and hey, we're in the [Wall Street Journal](https://www.wsj.com/articles/andreessen-horowitz-invests-in-visual-analytics-startup-preset-11570724008)!!

We are of course looking for good people to [join our team](https://preset.io/careers/). You should apply! Be sure to mention that I sent you. ðŸ˜‰

More to come, soon...
