The [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) framework is like balm for the wounds of modern frontend development.

I decided to use it to build a little frontend for [eventually.now](https://eventually.now), and for the first time in years I feel the way I did when I first dipped my toes into web development, writing HTML4.01 files and CSS2.
Svelte feels free and exciting and simple, the way the web should be. The bindings are so intuitive I didn't even look at any docs past the first basic examples.
