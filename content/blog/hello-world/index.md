Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm a slightly socially awkward mostly-self-taught programmer.

I've never [written publicly](https://medium.com/automation-generation/buying-and-selling-stocks-from-the-command-line-5b4dd5628078) much but this seems like a good enough time to start.
I may also add older things that I've written before I started this site.

I'm not sure what this blog will end up becoming, but right now I'm thinking of it as a public diary of sorts,
where I can explore my weird brain and bare my soul a bit.

By the way, [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) is great! I set this thing up in less than an hour,
it was super fast and provides lots of fun tools that I can use to tweak my site and add features.
