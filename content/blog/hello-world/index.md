description: "A brief introduction to me, this site and my motivations"
---

Hi, I'm Aaron. I'm a slightly socially awkward mostly-self-taught programmer.

I've never written publicly much but this seems like a good enough time to start.

I'm not sure what this blog will end up becoming, but right now I'm thinking of it as a public diary of sorts, 
where I can explore my weird brain and put it all out there.

By the way, Gatsby is great! I set this thing up in less than an hour,
it was super fast and I have complete control over my site.
